Adding sound to a Godot game involves the following steps:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Prepare Your Audio File**

* Supported formats: `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3` (OGG is preferred for looping music; WAV for short sound effects).
* Place your audio file inside the `res://` folder of your Godot project (e.g., `res://assets/sounds/`).

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Add an Audio Node to Your Scene**

There are two main nodes for sound:

| Use Case                | Node Type             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| For music or ambience   | `AudioStreamPlayer`   |
| For 3D positional sound | `AudioStreamPlayer3D` |

#### Steps:

1. Open your scene.
2. In the **Scene Tree**, click **+ Add Child Node**.
3. Search and add `AudioStreamPlayer`.
4. Rename it (e.g., `MusicPlayer` or `SFXPlayer`).

### ‚úÖ 3. **Assign an Audio File**

1. Select the `AudioStreamPlayer` node.
2. In the **Inspector**, look for the **Stream** property.
3. Click the file icon and choose your audio file.

### ‚úÖ 4. **Play the Sound**

You can play it in two ways:

#### Option A: Automatically on Scene Load

* Select the `AudioStreamPlayer`.
* In the Inspector, check the box **Autoplay**.

#### Option B: From a Script

Attach this to any node in the scene (e.g., `Main.gd`):

```gdscript
func _ready():
    $AudioStreamPlayer.play()
```

> üìç **Where to run this**: This script goes into a node‚Äôs attached `.gd` file inside Godot's built-in script editor. Make sure it runs in a scene where the `AudioStreamPlayer` node exists.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Control the Sound (Optional)**

```gdscript
# Play
$AudioStreamPlayer.play()

# Pause
$AudioStreamPlayer.stop()

# Change volume
$AudioStreamPlayer.volume_db = -10  # Lower is quieter

# Looping
$AudioStreamPlayer.stream.loop = true
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Test the Game**

Click **Play Scene (F6)** to test your sound in action.
